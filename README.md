# Singapore Airline
When taking SQ and have a stopover instead of direct flight. 
When checking-in at Changi ensure that the bag is tagged ALL THE WAY (to the final airport IATA code) so you should have both tickets since you have a transfer. 
If your stopover is at San Francisco, you will need to collect the bag from the international bag carousell and drop it off at the domestic check-in (which is directly outside the bag carousell) then you can go do anything and wait until you can go through security. Domestic terminal closes at midnight and opens at 5/6am but you can wait around outside of the security of domestic terminal.
IF YOUR BAG NOT TAGGED THROUGH, then in San Fran you need to wait until morning then you can retag the bag at San Fran airport. But eitherway the airport closes at midnight to open at 5/6am so you need wait outside the security check.
