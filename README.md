# Airlines
Buy tickets about 3 months before once get visa. 

Student discounts are available on Singapore Airlines, Emirates, Cathay Pacific, Turkish Airlines, Etihad, Qatar Airways, ANA, etc

1. Have a stopover
   
   1.1. When checking-in at Changi ensure that the bag is tagged ALL THE WAY (to the final airport IATA code) so you should have both tickets since you have a transfer.

   1.2.a. If your stopover is at San Francisco, you will need to collect the bag from the international bag carousell and drop it off at the domestic check-in (which is directly outside the bag carousell) then you can go do anything and wait until you can go through security. Domestic terminal closes at midnight and opens at 5/6am but you can wait around outside of the security of domestic terminal.

   1.2.b. IF YOUR BAG NOT TAGGED THROUGH, then in San Fran you need to wait until morning then you can retag the bag at San Fran airport. But eitherway the airport closes at midnight to open at 5/6am so you need wait outside the security check.

2. Direct flight

   2.1. Nothing out of the ordinary for you.

# Housing
All unsheltered parking lots are free for all. If got shelter is paid parking by per month so if you don’t have a lot number don’t use it. Will get towed.

School parking can park anywhere that doesn’t say “Visitor”. Need to get sticker from the dragon shop.

Wifi in the house is 1.2TB a month if you exceed you need to pay but they won’t tell you from which date to which date is a month. So if want to update your games or anything go to school and update or just go to the apartment housing office and use their wifi instead. Also some apartment wifi cannot submit work to school servers. This one all the lecturer (that I got last year) understand so they will give chance for the first time.

Electric usage also monitored and mostly all apartments in the Summit housing get warning for it. But none of them seem to use excessively so dunno why.

## Skyline Redmond
Furthest to school but nearest to Redmond City Center. Buy car if you stay here, you got fixed parking also.
## The Knoll
Units normally have a staircase in the house. Have fixed parking.
## The Summit
Quite new apartments. Need to climb the summit to get to the shuttlebus. Or can cut through shadowbrook to walk to school but if muddy then your shoe will also gone. BBQ pit is at this location. Facilities they look the newest. No fixed lots.
## Shadowbrook
I got no friend there so no comments. Have fixed parking.

# Mobility Options
5 options: [Shuttlebus](/README.md/#shuttle-bus), [Scooter](/README.md/#scooter), [Public Transport](/README.md/#public-transport), [Car](/README.md/#car), [Walk](/README.md/#walk)

## Shuttlebus
https://calendly.com/dragonride but it opens exactly 72 hours before for each slot so need to snatch.
## Scooter
https://unagiscooters.com/ worth the referral if a lot people using. At that time was 1 month free for both people the referral and referee.
## Public Transport
It is better to just walk to school or take a lime scooter on the uber app than to take the bus to redmond city center and back out to school.
## Car
Buy cars from Tacoma, Washington. The cars there are not very good looking, and some may be stolen but they are cheap and works for 3 months mainly. Don’t get luxury cars. Don’t get SUV. Buy a normal sedan that can get insurance. Insurance is mandatory, get state minimum. Then refund the remainder. Get international license. To process the refund you need to either have a bank account there or just deposit in friend account or bring back Singapore but you will lose like 150$USD on the cheque for clearance things.

I bought the cars from Skyline Motors in Tacoma, Washington. Go to https://www.carsforsale.com/ to see what car you interested in.

Go to https://www.kbb.com/ Kelly blue book, to see the book value of your car. This is roughly what you expecting to sell it back to the dealer. But if you sell to FB Marketplace you normally can just from the price of the car (not including sales tax and all) by like 20% got people will buy.

When buy car there is a few cost, Car, Sales tax based on where you registering the car, car registration with temp plate and insurance. Everything besides insurance you just tell the dealer help you do. Will be faster if not you need ownself go DMV to register and cannot drive the car off the lot until you get temp plates.

When you sell on FB marketplace, can ask them meet at Kirkland Costco which is near school also. Then around there got a DMV, Eastside Auto Licensing, https://www.eastsideautolicensing.com/ where you can go to do title transfer. The sales tax will be covered by the new owner. You just need to pay the title transfer which is 20+$. Ensure you do this if not the car still registered to you.

If you get car, see if you got other people that wanna share groceries. Then you all can one week go one time Costco, get the membership buy in bulk then when you want to leave just go back and cancel. They will refund the whole membership. Pump petrol also go Costco pump, not 24 hours but it works. Some places the rates also cheaper one like Tacoma that side. But if you go to the seattle premium outlet the own gas station there is cheaper and 24 hours. Learn how to pump also. Costco ONLY takes visa cards, can use revolut, transferwise, YOUTRIP IS MASTERCARD.

Most cars unlocks differently from Singapore, first unlock is driver only, second unlocks all door. Do not disable this functionality. If you drive alone to sketchy place this is to prevent anyone else getting in the car if you feel unsafe. 

Most people also don’t use the hand brake when they park their car unless steep hill. If the car doesn’t have a hand brake and is auto but has a third pedal the third pedal is your hand brake. Step in to engage. To release step further in and release to disengage.
## Walk
They will have an orientation day where they will show you how to walk to school.

# Things to do after you buy a car
1.	Buy insurance. Compare the big companies, state farm, all state, progressive, geico. Most that can buy progressive will buy it cause they big so slightly cheaper.
2.	Buy Good to Go tag, https://wsdot.wa.gov/travel/roads-bridges/toll-roads-bridges-tunnels/good-go-accounts-passes, this is basically ERP. Buy the flexpass one not the sticker tag then do pay as you go, their charges can be delayed one but when you sell car you need take off the tag and remove the car plate from your account if you added the car plate also. Cause if you more than one person you can go into the high occupancy vehicle lane (HOV) when there is ERP and not get charged but only for some roads.
3.	If you stay in skyline or going to the expressway from the Knoll to skyline side, READ THE SIGN, a lot people get horned at there.

# Banks
Bank of America and Chase all have student accounts for people under 24. Just need to bring proof of student which is your admin card, passport, proof of residence (letter when you receive your SIM card). They will not require a minimum balance until the date of your graduation which you can give whenever within a 4/5 year time period from when you create the account.

National park also got yearly pass, is worth if you go more than 4 or 5 times and for Mount Rainier is whole car get access. Check the national park website for status updates. Can go the skyline trail, but need check for status updates, https://www.alltrails.com/trail/us/washington/skyline-trail, this website has people posting everyday so you can judge yourself.

Bellvue malls

Redmond City Center

Saturday Market opposite school(go one time can liao overpriced)

Seattle premium outlet which is above the Redmond area.

Leavenworth can stay multiple nights and explore the place and go reindeer farm or join water sports. Then come back by the southern route to north bend, there quite scenic.

If buying expensive electronics, go Oregon cause there no tax on all items.

Oregon got the Microsoft wall paper stone, cannon beach

Bellvue gun range on weekday cause weekend foreigner cannot

Boeing future of flight and Boeing museum of flight

Microsoft Redmond store got a lot of merch there.

If want go Canada can go eat, lunch lady but need reservation. US number is same as Canada number for reservation.

4th of July is a good day to go out to see the fireworks and all but be prepared for the JAMMMMM, and if you drove you can take up to 3 hours to get out of the residential area that is near the old industrial area.

# Car Rental
Need get the crack windshield one and below 25 need pay more for young driver. They only accept credit cards unless you rent from the airport with a valid departure flight confirmation that line up with your return date.

Rent car from Enterprise, got one near school but need to book early. Enterprise cheaper than Hertz. Need international license cause they need an expiry date which our Driving license don’t have.

---
# To survive
KFC check the promotion, every Tuesday had one bucket 5 pcs for 10$ very worth.
QFC is a supermarket, if you don’t have car or need something specific can get from here
TraderJoe is more expensive QFC.
Costco if you can buy everything here then good but all is bulk.

---
# Phone Lines
Get mint mobile for 90 days is the cheapest based on what we checked. Mail it to your mailbox of your housing complex. You can order it like the day you reach or like 2 days before.

---
# Studies
Go school library borrow the Texas Instruments Nspire cx II calculator for the math mod. Can help you do a lot of things if you know how to use it. Can use for Graphics quiz also if you can make a program or excel sheet that can do everything.

Go to spirit week to get scales and the “things to do while as a digipen student” paper then you can see all the activities they recommend.

Go to sports games and everything the school create if you got time, got minigolf and beach day de. But if you cannot do finish work then don’t go real.

# Splitting the bill
Easier with Splitwise, so you can split evenly by the number of people you have in the group or how many people you select or by item. Then it can nett value for whole group or just you owe me how much I deduct off from the amount I owe you.

---
# Taxes
Redmond and Kirkland mostly have no taxes on food that you need to cook yourself. Other things can be ranging from 6.5% to 10.4%. This one you can clarify on the website for sales tax. https://www.avalara.com/taxrates/en/state-rates/washington/cities/redmond.html or the base website which is https://www.avalara.com/taxrates/en/state-rates.html then search where you at to know the tax rates.

---
# Parking
Seattle parking can use spothero, https://spothero.com/, to get better day rates. So like you park for a day at cheaper rates but is more for weekends only cause they is rent out office building parkings.

Around Redmond and Kirkland and all smaller city parking is normally free. Roadside or mall also same just that you need look out for signs sometime at lift lobby that ask you to pay then that one is paid parking.

---
# Maps
Always download google maps offline when going anywhere even if you using waze. If Waze is set, NEVER turn off the app even if you just stopping for breakfast or anything. Sometimes mid trip will not have network just keep driving, if you reset the app use back up google maps offline which is not as accurate. 

---
# Memberships
Always use email aliases if possible. So lets just say your email is abc123@gmail.com and alias just adds +whateveryouwant to the email address so it will be abc123+whateveryouwant@gmail.com, it will still go to your main email but if you wanna complain using your member email your From needs to be edited to your email alias which can be done is all email settings menu. Some memberships don’t allow alias cause they don’t want you having multiple accounts like Nike is global accounts.

Using alias also easy to know who leaked your email and can search easier on your email list sometimes cause some companies use 3rd party email platforms that don’t show their name normally until the email content.

---
# Prof
Brandon Race Roberson: iirc worked for NASA goes hiking regularly very IT in the know.
Alexander Young: Very good math prof he can reexplain in a different way to fit your thinking.
Steve Rabin: His test has content that he will mention in class but not in his slides. If majority of the class slowly don't come then there will be no video recording.

# Where to buy tech
Amazon first

Walmart for cheaper electronics (best place if cannot find online deals)

Newegg for computers

Bestbuy is a no go

Costco is sometimes the promotion is good cause they bulk but you don’t have every tech inside.

---
# Costco
Every Costco is different. Around school got 2. Kirkland and Redmond, promotions for both are different cause different demographics. Redmond got more alcohol promotions when we went and wider range of liquor.

If buying alcohol, whole group that goes in need to bring passport. Cashier can ask to verify for whole group. So if buying just one person go to cashier better, especially if you all member is one person but another person paying, just have the member take the persons card to go pay.

You can choose to refund the membership at the end of your stay. Will go back to the card you paid with. Bring that card when you want to refund cause the system will check if the correct card presented.

---
# Gym
Nearest on the way to school with decent pricing is https://www.eastsidegym.com/

# Things to buy before going
Some type B only travel adapters (cause more stable with 3rd pin). So that you can just plug it into the house and have it live in some of the plugs for ease.

![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/cb7b12e5-73a3-4e5b-af4b-2986be7c5e3d)

Some washing pods for clothes. But if no space, can go get Costco membership then buy at Costco is about same price +/- 15% but if you buy elsewhere is more expensive like + 50%. Washing pods leave a plastic residue so you can choose to go there buy detergent and softener instead. Quite obvious on dark color clothes if the plastic of the washing pods dissolve.

Hangers if you don’t want to fold things or have a lot of things to hang. But can buy there also. Roughly they give like 10-15 per person but is rough number every house is different count so by luck. Clothes that cannot be put in dryer need put on hanger to dry in the house.

If you like hot pot cause first few weeks are cold, or you want to have your friend group gather in your apartment can buy some HDL soup base from scarlett. Is about 50% to 150% more expensive in US.

---
# Any other questions
Just text me where you wanna go and if we have anything we had to watch out before hand lor. I will try rmb then tell you. But I think only national parks have things to watch out the rest don’t exactly have.

Or just leave an issue in the github repository.
